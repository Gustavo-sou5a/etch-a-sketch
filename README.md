# etch-a-sketch
Forth project of "The Odin Project" course

The goal of this project is to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 

This project is intended for me to became more familiar with DOM manipulation, putting in practice what I have learned from HTML, CSS an JavaScript until this moment.

At the end of this project, I expect to be more comfortable with JavaScript and manipulate better the DOM with it.
